he provided code outlines a basic React app structure for a Swiggy clone with four main screens:

Login Screen: Allows users to log in using their phone number and OTP.
Main Screen: Displays non-scrollable CTAs, resembling the Swiggy home screen.
Food Screen: Features a scrollable section with options to select restaurants.
Instamart Screen: Similar to the Food Screen, but focused on groceries with CTAs for Instamart.
Each screen is represented by a separate component (LoginScreen, MainScreen, FoodScreen, and InstamartScreen) and is routed using React Router. This structure can be expanded upon and styled according to specific design requirements.
